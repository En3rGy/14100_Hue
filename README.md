# 14100 Hue Group

## Description 

The logic module provides an interface to specific Hue lights, groups, rooms, zones, etc. Registered devices can be 
controlled and the device status is provided via the modules output. The module registers itself at the hue bridge 
using the Hue [Hue API v2](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/) and the _eventstream_ function. Using 
multiple instances of the logic module, just one will register for the _eventstream_ and provides received date to the 
other ones.

One module provides an auto discovery on the Hue bridge in order to receive the bridges IP address. A HS reboot is
necessary, if the bridge IP chances!

All outputs are configured as _send-by-change (sbc)_.

### Useage
#### Information Website and Set-up of logic module
[Hue API v2](https://developers.meethue.com/develop/hue-api-v2/) addresses each device using a non-readable ID.<br>
This ID must be provided to the logic module instance of the corresponding Hue device (1 Hue Device : 1 Logic Module 
 Instance).<br>
In oder to identify the Hue ID of a specific device, one logic module creates a webpage showing the IDs and the 
corresponding rooms and device names (**Information Website**). The link to this page is shown on the debug page in the logic modules section 
within the _HSL 2.0_ section and represents this scheme: `http://<HS-IP>:<Port>`<br>
**Create at least one instance of the logic module and identify the Hue IDs of the devices you would like to control.**

Set up an instance of the logic module for each hue item you would like to control or monitor the status.<br>
**In general, use the `light` or `grouped light` ID.**

#### Switch on/off a Light
- Identify the light ID on the info page
- Put the ID on [input 4](#input_4) (usually constant, the idea is to have one logic module per light/room/zone)
- Use [input 8](#input_8) to switch the light on or off

*Note: If you want to switch on a room or a zone, use the rooms / zones ID on [input 4](#input_4)*

#### Command a scene
- Identify the scene  ID on the info page. Caution! Each light has its own scene.
  - Identify the tabel row of the light / room
  - Identify the ID of the desired scene
- Write the scene ID on [input 5](#input_5) (this will switch on the light if it was off before)
- Set [input 6](#input_6) to one if you want to activate the dynamic behaviour of the scene

## Software Design Description
As far as possible, the module is developed object orientated.
Two major objects exist:
- Bridge Objekt<br>For communication with Hue Bridge, incl. Bridge Discovery
- Hue Item Objekt<br>For commanding Hue-Objects, e.g. lights, rooms, scenes, etc.
An essential element of the Hue API v2 is the *Eventstream*. Programmes can register for this and receive status changes from the Hue Bridge almost immediately.

With several Hue logic devices, only one of the devices connects to the event stream and forwards incoming messages to all other Hue devices. 
This is done via the common scope, a connection of the devices via iKO is *not* necessary.

In addition:
- Lamps / Scenes / Zones / Rooms / Groups are distinguished via the Id; query of the type via /resource {data{id, type}}.
- Depending on the action, the respective rid is searched for via the device id.
- Only one device connects to the Hue Bridge, the others use this connection via [HS Instances](http://127.0.0.1/doc_extra/de/commloginst.html)
- The eventstream connection runs in a separate thread in a `while true` loop
- If there is no network connection at initialisation time, signals on the device inputs will attempt to connect to the bridge. 

Used libraries:
- https://github.com/benknight/hue-python-rgb-converter for Hue color conversion from/to rgb.

## Validation & Verification
- Unit tests are performed.
